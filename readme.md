## Windows Mario World
This is that Super Mario World hack that I released a demo of on 25 December 2014. If you want the demo, you can find that [right here](https://www.smwcentral.net/?a=details&id=10412&p=section).

Since that demo, there were a few updates to the game that never saw the light of day, though I did release videos of some levels. This repository contains everything, and I mean everything, that I used while creating this.

There are no ROMs in this repository, only patches; it's up to you to obtain a back-up ROM to patch.

I was in high school when I started making this, and every time I made some progress, I would make a copy of the game and put it on my DS. All these years later, I still had all those copies, so I made individual patches for each of those. I find it interesting to see how things change through development, and this hack sure did change a whole lot from when I started it, to how it ended up in the latest build. Of course, for most people, I'm sure the latest build will be the most interesting, and this is also included.

All who find this have my permission to use or modify this in any way. I'd appreciate some credit, of course, but I probably won't find out if you don't credit me.

Anyway, enjoy the game!
